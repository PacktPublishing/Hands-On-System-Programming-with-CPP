**Build performant and concurrent Unix and Linux systems with C++17	**

## What is this book about?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias toward system programming as it provides ready access to hardware-level resources, efficient compilation, and a versatile approach to higher-level abstractions.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the benefits of using C++ for system programming 
* Program Linux/Unix systems using C++ 
* Discover the advantages of Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) 
* Program both console and file input and output 
* Uncover the POSIX socket APIs and understand how to program them 
* Explore advanced system programming topics, such as C++ allocators 
* Use POSIX and C++ threads to program concurrent systems 
* Grasp how C++ can be used to create performant system applications

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
int array[10];

auto r1 = array + 1;
auto r2 = *(array + 1);
auto r3 = array[1];
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a fresh developer with intermediate knowledge of C++ but little or no knowledge of Unix and Linux system programming, this book will help you learn system programming with C++ in a practical way.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
